					As a Full Stack Developer with over a year of experience in coding, I
					have gained expertise in multiple programming languages, including
					JavaScript, Ruby, Python, and TypeScript. Prior to my career in
					coding, I spent 8 years as a computer mechanic and store manager,
					which gave me valuable experience in both technical and managerial
					roles.

					My deep understanding of React and Redux allows me to develop robust
					and efficient applications. I am constantly learning and staying
					up-to-date with the latest technologies and industry trends, as I am
					passionate about providing the best possible solutions for my clients
					or customers.
				</p>
				<p className='text-xl'>
					When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing video games and experimenting
					with new recipes in the kitchen. I believe that these hobbies allow me
					to approach problem-solving with a fresh perspective, and help me stay
					creative and adaptable in my work.
